# List Comprehension
#
# The  exercises that follow will be practice on basic list comprehension syntax like:

temperatures = [-5, 29, 26, -7, 1, 18, 12, 31]
temperatures_adjusted = [temp + 20 for temp in temperatures]

# and basic zip syntax like:
x = zip([1, 2, 3], [4, 6, 8])

# Also, along the way  will be practicing these core Python concepts:
"""
* Strings and substrings
* Getting characters from an index
* Boolean operators and comparators
* Mathematical operations
* String concatenation
* Casting from an integer to a string
